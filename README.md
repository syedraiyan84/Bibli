# Why Use This Code?

Analyze Bibliometric Data: Process citation and bibliographic data to identify trends, authorship patterns, and citation networks.
Simplify Data Preparation: Automate the cleaning and transformation of raw bibliometric data into formats that can be easily imported into BibExcel.
Enhance Network Analysis: Enable detailed analysis of relationships between authors, articles, or keywords, and visualize the results in an intuitive format.

# BibExcel Package

A python executable to get JSON and Excel data from a bibexcel text file

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## How to Use the Code

# Prepare Your Data:

Collect bibliometric data from sources like Web of Science, Scopus, or Google Scholar. Ensure the data is in a supported format (such as .csv, .ris, .bib, etc.).
The code may require data in a specific format, such as tab-separated values or a list of citations.

# Install Required Tools:

BibExcel is a standalone tool, but some parts of this repository may require additional Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis. You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Load Your Data into the Code:

Import your bibliometric data into the script. Modify the file path or format in the code if necessary to match your input file.

Make sure your input data includes citation, author, or keyword information in the required structure.

# Process the Data:

Run the provided Python script to clean, process, and transform your bibliometric data into a format compatible with BibExcel.
For example, you might use the following command to execute the script:

python process_bibliometric_data.py

# Use BibExcel to Analyze Data:

Import the processed data (e.g., CSV or text file) into BibExcel for further analysis.
Use BibExcel's built-in features to perform network analysis, generate co-citation matrices, analyze author collaborations, or visualize keyword clusters.
